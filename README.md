# TensorFlow.js-Prediction-Model-4-Limbo
A webpage that uses TensorFlow.js to train a model in the browser. Given Nonce, Client Seed, and Hashed Server Seed, the model will learn to predict the outcome,

## Basis
Given a hashed server seed, client seed, and progressive naunce, associations with the hashed server seed to asspciate a limbo outcome may form a different hashed seed and outcome relationship that hopefully results in something being predictable.

Suggestions and improvements as well as corrections are welcome and invited. I'm just giving it a try, so don't expect anything too serious. Fork if you do.
